Default verbose summation
analyze â€“v: 

!process: The !process extension displays information about the specified process, or about all processes, including the EPROCESS block.
!thread: The !thread extension displays summary information about a thread on the target system, including the ETHREAD block. This command can be used only during kernel-mode debugging

Running threads
!running -it: The !running extension displays a list of running threads on all processors of the target computer.
               -i Causes the display to include idle processors as well
               -t Causes a stack trace to be displayed for each processor.

Non MS Drivers
k[v]: Displays frame pointer omission (FPO) information. On x86-based processors, the display also includes calling convention information.
!stacks: The !stacks extension gives a brief summary of the state of every thread. You can use this extension instead of the !process extension to get a quick overview of the system, especially when debugging multithread issues such as resource conflicts or deadlocks.

u: The u\* commands display an assembly translation of the specified program code in memory.
uf: The uf command displays an assembly translation of the specified function in memory.

Drivers
lm t n:The lm command lists all of the modules and the status of symbols for each module.
          t: Displays the file time stamps. When you use t, symbol type information is not displayed.
          n: Displays the image name. When you use n, symbol type information is not displayed.

Outstanding IO
!object: The !object extension displays information about a system object.
!irp: The !irp extension displays information about an I/O request packet (IRP).

dpu mrxsmb!SmbCeContext

Freezes and lockups


!analyze -v -hang
!thread
!running -it

!locks: The !locks extension displays all locks held on resources by threads. A lock can be shared or exclusive, which means no other threads can gain access to that resource. This information is useful when a deadlock occurs on a system. A deadlock is caused by one non-executing thread holding an exclusive lock on a resource that the executing thread needs.
!qlocks: The !qlocks extension displays the state of all queued spin locks.

!stacks
!vm: The !vm extension displays summary information about virtual memory use statistics on the target system.
!memusage: The !memusage extension displays summary statistics about physical memory use.

!poolused [n] : The !poolused extension displays memory use summaries, based on the tag used for each pool allocation.
               3: nonpaged pool 
               5: paged pool
